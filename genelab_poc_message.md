## Subject: Research Tool for OSDR Data - Seeking Your Guidance

Hi [POC Name],

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to reach out about a research project I've been working on that might be of interest to the GeneLab community, and I'd really value your perspective on it.

## What I Built

I've developed an AI-powered research tool that enhances how researchers can explore OSDR data. It adds some capabilities that I thought might be useful for the space biology community:

**Key Features:**
- **AI Semantic Search**: Natural language queries like "effects of microgravity on cardiovascular system in mammals"
- **Knowledge Graph Visualization**: Interactive maps showing relationships between studies, organisms, and factors
- **AI-Powered Study Comparisons**: Automated analysis comparing related research
- **Real-time Integration**: ISS tracking and space weather data alongside research data

**Technical Approach:**
- Built using public OSDR APIs (respects all data usage policies)
- Cloud-deployed with modern AI/ML stack (Vertex AI, Neo4j, MongoDB)
- Open source with full transparency

## My Question for You

I'm wondering if this type of tool might be valuable for GeneLab researchers, and if so, what would be the best way to share it with the community? I want to be thoughtful about how this fits within GeneLab's ecosystem.

**I'm completely flexible on approach:**
- Could keep it as an unofficial community tool with clear disclaimers
- Happy to collaborate on integration with official channels if there's interest
- Could contribute code/concepts to existing GeneLab initiatives
- Or keep it private if that's more appropriate

## Why I'm Reaching Out to You First

Given your role and our connection through [mention specific events/interactions], I wanted to get your read on:
1. Whether the community would find this type of tool useful
2. The best way to share it (if at all) without stepping on any toes
3. Any concerns or considerations I should be aware of

## No Pressure!

This is purely exploratory - I built this as a learning project and thought it might help researchers, but I want to make sure I'm approaching it the right way. If it's not a good fit for sharing, that's totally fine too.

Would you be open to a quick call to discuss, or would you prefer I send you a demo link to check out first?

Thanks for your time and guidance!

Best,
[Your Name]
